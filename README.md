# Google Play Store App Download Prediction
**********************************************************

## About the project
**********************************************************
As people tend to spend more time on their mobile apps, it also becomes harder for developers/businesses to develop a popular app.     
In this project, I will try to predict the number of installs (target variable) from some features of the app itself using machine learning models. I am trying to find out what kind of apps are more popular and tend to stay longer in peopleâ€™s phones. Number of installs is divided into four groups, 0, 1, 2, and 3. This is a classification problem. Four models are used: Random forest, SVC, k-NN, and XGBoost.
